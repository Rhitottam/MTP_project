Their spinel structure was confirmed by XRD.The variation in lattice parameter and density with cobalt concentration was studiedwhich showed an increasing trend. A decreasing pattern was observed in variation ofporosity with increasing Co. Room temperature dielectric constant and resistivitywere studied as a function of composition at 10 KHz. The room temperature dielectricconstant decreases with successive addition of Co2+ in the series. The observedvariation in dielectric constant has been explained on the basis of space chargepolarization and Koops two layer model. Resistivity is observed to increase withincreasing concentration and the observed variation in resistivity has beenexplained by Verwey hopping mechanism.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], educationalAlignment_educationalLevel=[ug_pg], publisher=[IACS], identifier_uri=[http://hdl.handle.net/10821/242], learningResourceType=[article]}

These neutrons will be absorbedthrough radiative capture and emit gamma radiations. Thus it is essential that aneffective shield should contain a large amount of moderating material, hydrogenbeing preferred with low atomic number materials (B, C, Li) and lead (Pb) to ensurethat the neutrons do not diffuse at intermediate energies in the shield as well asgamma attenuation will also take place.

The sharpening of band with Zn- content (x) is due to the fact that the system changes from inverse to normal spinel structure.

The optimized structural parameters and the computed vibrational wavenumbers of the compound have been estimated from ab initio HF and DFT calculations. Some vibrational modes of the molecule have been reassigned. The adsorptive behavior of 2-ABT on a colloidal silver surface at different adsorbate concentrations, close to that encountered under physiological conditions in living systems has been elucidated from the SERS spectra.

The adsorptive behavior of these molecules on the colloidal silver surface at two different adsorbate concentrations recorded in different time domains have been elucidated from the SERS spectra. The silver surface may serve as an analogue for the artificial biological interface. The experimentally observed SERS spectra are compared with the theoretically modeled 2-AMBT-Ag (I) surface complexes using ab initio RHF and DFT calculations. Themost favorable adsorptive sites of the 2-AMBT molecule have been estimated by natural population analysis (NPA) using the above-mentioned high level of theories.Chapter 5 discusses the studies on the experimental and theoretical NRS, SERS and FTIR of 2-Amino-6-methylbenzothiazole (2A-6MBT) molecule.

From the biotechnological and biomedical applications point of view, studies on lipids and proteins have been playing a significant role in developing protocols for drug delivery and immunosensing system, various biomolecular devices etc. The immobilization of protein without denaturation on solid support, or on lipid membrane, is extremely valuable and is the fundamental step for designing such devices.This dissertation entitled as STUDIES OF PROTEIN LIPID INTERACTION AT AIR/WATER INTERFACE BY LANGMUIR-BLODGETT TECHNIQUE deals with some studies on lipids, proteins/enzymes with the aim to understand various aspects of lipid-protein interaction. The main thrust of the work involves the development and characterization of protein/protein-lipid films on air/water interface and subsequent transfer on a solid substrate. Besides the characterization, the aim is also to minimize the aggregation of protein in lipid matrix as well as to prepare the protein-lipid mixed film with networks of individual protein molecules. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) and Self Assembly (SA) techniques have been used to prepare the desired systems. Moreover, combination of different techniques are used to comprehend the basic science behind the lipid/protein film formation, influence of surface treatment and protein/enzyme interaction, the role of net charge of the protein/lipid etc. This dissertation comprises of seven chapters and one appendix. Chapter 1 elucidates the necessities for studying the scientific interdisciplinary works. It highlights the need of studies on the adsorption of protein at bare air/water interface and into lipid membrane. It focuses on the interaction between lipids and proteins and the necessities for immobilization of proteins and protein-lipid complexes onto solid supports with minimum aggregation and denaturation of protein. It also contains a general introduction with a brief overview of relevant parts of existing works and concepts required to interpret the experimental results.Chapter 2 focuses on the experimental techniques, which are used for the formation of enzyme/protein, and protein-lipid mixed thin film. It also describes the different characterization techniques to study the enzyme/protein and protein-lipid mixed film.Chapter 3 focuses on the effect of salt (KCl) on the interfacial surface activity and the formation of yeast alcohol dehydogenease (ADH) monolayer at air/water interface using Langmuir-Blodgett technique. It elucidates the effect of salt on the formation of ADH monolayer. It also highlights on the compressibility, rigidity and unfolding of ADH at air/KCl-water interface. The observed significant changes above 0.1M KCl concentrations are explained in context of the DLVO theory. CD and FTIR spectroscopic studies together with AFM imaging of ADH monolayer indicate that KCl perturbs the ADH monolayer by incrementing the ?-structure resulting into larger unfolding and intermolecular aggregates at high salt concentration.Chapter 4 elucidates the surface activity of an enzyme, pepsin at air/water interface with salt (KCl), pH variation in subphase as well as the incorporation into a cationic octadecylamine monolayer. It also highlights on the area/molecule, compressibility, rigidity, unfolding of pepsin at air/KCl-water interface with pH closest to its isoelectric point (optimized subphase) as well as into the lipid monolayer. The structural aspects of deposited pepsin films at different conditions are analyzed by using FE-SEM and FTIR spectroscopy to study the conformational change of Pepsin, due to thin film formation by LB technique at different environmental conditions.Chapter 5 describes the comparative study of the incorporation of a protein; ovalbumin (OVA) within octadecylamine (ODA), 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and stearic acid (STA) suggests that it is more preferable in case of ODA (cationic) than DPPC (zwitterionic) and STA (anionic) lipid monolayer due to electrostatic interaction. The incorporation of OVA into different monolayers is found to be surface pressure dependent and more in LE region than in condensed region. Addition of STA and ODA quenches tryptophan fluorescence by perturbing tyrosine excitation. However, addition of DPPC does not perturb tyrosine moieties, indicates a little perturbation of OVA structure. Tyrosine may be the binding site with STA as well as ODA. Although higher accumulation of OVA occurs in case of ODA monolayer yet FE-SEM and fluorescence study supports that DPPC monolayer is better to get protein lipid mixed film than STA and ODA monolayer. It also suggests that the extent of aggregation of protein in protein-lipid mixed film is less in zwitterionic lipid monolayer however can not be minimized by LB film deposition technique. Chapter 6 deals with a comparative study on the films fabricated by self-assembly (SA) of OVA-DPPC vesicle on glass substrate and SA of OVA on prefabricated LB film of DPPC. It also focuses on the immobilization of DPPC and OVA-DPPC vesicles on solid substrate by simple drop-cast technique. FTIR analyses of amide bands are being used to inspect the extent of the conformational transitions of ?-sheet to ?-helix of OVA in immobilized DPPC vesicles. FE-SEM imaging of immobilized OVA-DPPC vesicles provide the structure of individual OVA molecule attached with DPPC, without aggregation amongst them.Chapter 7 describes the concluding remarks of overall study and future perspectives.

The present thesis focuses its attention towards unrevealing the properties of differentorganized media through probing the environment sensitive dye. The thesis comprises sixchapter ( chapter 3 to chapter 8) including a review on charge transfer reaction in Chapter 1followed a brief account of the experimental techniques with the details of instrumentation setup and methods of calculations of certain physical parameters in Chapter 2. The methods ofcompound preparation and purification are also described in Chapter 2.Excited state photophyiscs of 2-(4-(dimethylamino) styryl)-1-methylpyridium iodide(DASPMI) in ionic and nonionic micelles have been reported in Chapter 3. The probing ofthree micelles have been done with the help of DASPMI using the environmental sensitivity.The necessary shift and change in intensity reveals that DASPMI enters into all three micellesin different positions from the water solution due to active hydrophobic force and electrostaticfield. The binding constant and variation of emission intensity reveal that only in non-ionicmicelle the probe enters in the core region whereas in ionic micelles it is anchored in theinterfacial region with different orientations. From the observed data it may be guessed that thedonor group (NMe2) of the probe is in Gouy-Chapman layer and the acceptor group resides inthe Stern layer for cationic micelle whereas for anionic micelle the reverse phenomena isobserved. With salt addition increase in aggregation number, mechanically trapped water andthe microviscosity modulate emission intensity. Excited state photophysics of 2-(4-(dimethylamino) styryl)-1-methylpyridium iodide(DASPMI) in anionic and cationic reverse micelles (RMs) have been described in Chapter 4.From steady state data there was an indication to reside the molecule in the interfacial region near the core keeping acceptor group towards water pool in anionic micelle and for cationicmicelle it was away from the core as we increase the pool size (W) of the reverse micelle. Thepartition constant Kp in two RMs correlate well with the position of emitting probe DASPMI inRMs interface and it corresponds nicely with the values obtained from anisotropy data. Therotational restriction experienced by DASPMI in anionic reverse micelle decreases withincreasing hydration. The in-situ measurements of micropolarity and microviscosity around theprobe with increasing pool size (W) show enhanced micropolarity and a decrease inmicroviscosity. Increased emission quenching by Cu2+ is due to counterion exchange of Cu2+by Na+ at the micellar interface and due to increased local concentration of Cu2+.Chapter 5 deals with photophysics of 2-(4-(dimethylamino) styryl)-1-methylpyridium iodide(DASPMI) in different Cyclodextrin environments. Nice 1:1 inclusion complex with ?-CD inthe excited state could be found with the dimethylamino group of the molecule sticking out asrevealed from steady state and time-resolved emission. The inclusion complex has a longerdecay time compared to that in neat water. Time-resolved anisotropy decay has been used tostudy the rotational dynamics of the molecule inside cyclodextrin cavity. The average angularstructure of inclusion complex as found from semiemperical PM3 calculations corroborates theexperimental results of angular orientation in ?-CD excellently. The minimum energy of thecomplex is found to be nearly 5 Å length of the molecule with dimethylamino part sticking outin the bulk water. Hydrogen bonding at the rim hinders inclusion complex of o-DASPMI in ?-CD and instead it produces association at the rim. Hydrogen bond breaker urea breaks thebonding of o-DASPMI with the rim of ?-CD and the formation of inclusion complex with ?-CD ensues. The interaction of anionic micelle Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and amphiphilic blockcopolymers poly ethylene-b-polyethylene glycol (PE-b-PEG) and the sharp change of excitedstate charge transfer complex photophysics of 2-(4-(dimethylamino) styryl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI) inside the supramolecular assembly have been addressedin Chapter 6. The dramatic enhancement of emission intensity of DASPMI incorporatedinside the nano structure formed by micellar and polymeric chains indicates completelydifferent environment, compared to that in water and micellar system. The SEM picture alsoconfirmed the formation of assembly between the polymer and the micelle. Huge increase inrotational relaxation time obtained from time-resolved anisotropy decay and the value of orderparameter is indicative of much restrictive regime in the self assembly system. The wobblingand translational motion of the probe is also restricted inside micelle-polymer aggregate due tothe presence of polymer chains. The translational diffusion coefficient gets drastically reduceddue to the aggregation. The composite polymer micelle system has got a solvent reorientationtime.Chapter 7 deals with the mode of interaction of 2-(4-(dimethylamino) styryl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI) with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in buffer as well as inreverse micelle (RM) environments. The binding of DASPMI with BSA is confirmed by FieldEmission Scanning Microscope (FESEM), Cyclic Voltametry (CV), Circular Dichroic Spectra(CD) and 1H NMR techniques. The most important thing of the investigation is that subdomainIIA of BSA is doubly active inside RM compared to that in buffer solution and the activity ofsubdomain IIIA in RM is halved compared to that in buffer solution. The values ofmicropolarity around the probe helps us to determined the actual sites of BSA, responsible forbinding. The time resolved decay time further corroborate this attachment of DASPMI withdifferent sites of BSA in different environments. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer(FRET) from BSA to DASPMI in buffer solution is measured to be 27% whereas, for that in reverse micelle it is found to be increased to 36%. The greater FRET efficiency also indicatesthat probe is located much more nearer to Tryptophan (Trp) of BSA and stronger bindingbetween BSA-DASPMI complex in RM than in buffer.The mode of binding of 2-(4-(dimethylamino) styryl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI)with calf thymus DNA as revealed from different steady state and time-resolved emissionspectroscopic measurements has been reported in Chapter 8. Fluorescence enhancement ofDASPMI and its quenching by KI and also strong dependence on ionic strength or salt incontrolling the binding of DASPMI with DNA by electrostatic interaction confirms groovebinding. The value of binding constant from emission and association constant from circulardichroic spectrum also indicates weak binding. Increase in steady state anisotropy andfluorescence lifetime hints at binding with DNA. Visualization of theoretical modelingconfirms groove binding as a crescent with a curvature of 11.35 ?, which is complementary tothe natural curvature of the minor of B-DNA.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], educationalAlignment_educationalLevel=[ug_pg], identifier_uri=[http://hdl.handle.net/10821/274], learningResourceType=[thesis]}

The probe molecule exhibits a strong solventpolarity-dependent characteristic. The low-energy fluorescenceband of DASQMI shows an anomalous 40 nm blue shift inwater from that in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); though indeuterium oxide the normal trend of red shift was observed. Amarked increase in intensity of this band at 77 K and an increasein lifetime in viscous solvent point clearly to the intramolecularcharge-transfer (ICT) character of the low-energy band. Fromthe temperature-dependent emission and emission spectra inmixed solvents, the negative solvatochromism of DASQMI has been established, which means that the ICT state moves towardground state with polarity and hydrogen-bond ability and beyond a critical dielectric constant coupled with protic nature of thesolvent ground state gets further stabilized to show anomalous blue shift. In ethanol, below a critical temperature, 253 K, a blue shiftstarts due to greater solvent molecular polarization. A third long-lifetime component with dominant 75% amplitude was observedonly in aqueous solution and may be due to the cis-isomer of hydrophobic DASQMI, a stable form in the excited state predictedfrom polarizable continuum model (PCM) calculations in water with 6-31G+(d,p) as basis set.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], relation=[J.

Time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) and more precisely time-resolved area normalized emission spectra (TRANES) depict the evolution of the dynamics of excited state species and the charge transfer. Hindrance of rotational relaxation in restricted environments causes intensified charge transfer emission quantum yield.

SDS and SDS-PE-b-PEG form unilamellar (ULV) and multilamellar vesicles (MLV), respectively, along with the rod-shaped colloidal structures as observed from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. This dye causes a variation in the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio and forms a hydrogen bond with the copolymer in the SDS-PE-b-PEG complex and subjected to electrostatic interaction with the SDS micelle in aqueous solution, which causes this morphological transformation. These vesicles show complete encapsulation of a hydrophobic dye in its interior as evident from the TEM images. ULV get ruptured at low pH, pointing toward their lower stability over MLV at low pH value.

This is because, experimentally, such optimization involves a huge number of trials;whereas the number of trials needed to optimize the performance of such semiconductor devices, can be decimated, using computer modeling, whichis nowadays therefore widely recognized as a tool for faster progress of such research. A detailed computer model, as opposed to simple analyticalmodels, is where the Poissons equation and the electron- and hole-continuity equations are all solved from the first principles, without resorting toany simplifying assumptions. It is therefore, only such detailed models that are capable of giving an insight into device performance. Such modelsbecome very complicated in the case of disordered semiconductors, where we also have to take into account the trapping and recombination kineticsthrough the gap states. Moreover, in order to model both the electrical and optical properties of opto-electronic devices based on semiconductors intheir entirety, we also need to combine the electrical model with a suitable optical model, capable of calculating not only the absorption in eachportion of the device, but also the losses suffered by reflection or absorption in the non-active layers of the device. Moreover, diffused reflectance,transmittance and absorption when the device is deposited on a textured or rough surface also need to be taken into account; as also specularinterference effects when the interfaces are flat. In this review, we will discuss a detailed electrical-optical model that is capable of modeling theperformance of a general n-layer device based on crystalline, amorphous, poly-, micro- or nano-crystalline semiconductor, with particular referenceto the modeling of opto-electronic devices, such as solar cells and color sensors.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], educationalAlignment_educationalLevel=[ug_pg], publisher=[IACS], identifier_uri=[http://hdl.handle.net/10821/205], learningResourceType=[article]}

The Hamiltonian is solved by using Zubarevs Greensfunction technique to calculate CDW gap (.) and magnetization (Md)in t2g band. Bothof them are solved self-consistently. Their combined effect on the temperaturedependent magnetization (Mc) due to the eg band electrons is investigated. Both themagnitude and the transition temperature of (Mc) are strongly influenced by both .and Md. Hence the hopping of the band electrons are strongly controlled by these twolong range interactions.

Non-isothermal studies were carried outusing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to obtain the activation energy of thermaldecomposition for CTA polymer. The CTA samples decompose in one main break downstage. The results indicate that the irradiation by electron beam in the dose range80200 kGy increases the thermal stability of the polymer samples. Also, thevariation of melting temperatures with the electron dose has been determined usingdifferential thermal analysis (DTA). The CTA polymer is characterized by theappearance of one endothermic peak due to melting. It is found that the irradiationin the dose range 1080 kGy causes defects generation that splits the crystalsdepressing the melting temperature, while at higher doses (80200 kGy), thethickness of crystalline structure (lamellae) is increased, thus the meltingtemperature increases. In addition, the transmission of these samples in thewavelength range 2002500 nm, as well as any color changes, were studied. The colorintensity .E* was greatly increased on increasing the electron beam dose, andaccompanied by a significant increase in the blue color component.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], educationalAlignment_educationalLevel=[ug_pg], publisher=[Indian J.

CR-39 is one ofthe most popular polymeric track detectors, however its aliphatic nature restrictsits applications. Thus in the present investigations the damage densities producedby solar radiations to the polymer have been estimated by analyzing the structural,physical and etching properties of the polymer.

Solid State Nuclear Track Detector (SSNTD) based systems, being the bestsuited for large scale passive monitoring, have been widely used for the radon gas(using a cup closed with a semi-permeable membrane) and to a limited extent, for themeasurement of radon progeny (using bare mode in conjunction with the cup). Thesehave been employed for radon mapping and indoor radon epidemiological studies withgood results. In this technique, alpha tracks recorded on SSNTD films are convertedto radon/thoron concentrations using corresponding conversion factors obtained fromcalibration experiments carried out in controlled environments. The detector response to alpha particles depends mainly on the registrationefficiency of the alpha tracks on the detector films and the subsequent countingefficiency. While the former depends on the exposure design, the latter depends onthe protocols followed for developing and counting of the tracks. The paperdiscusses on parameters like etchant temperature, stirring of the etchant andduration of etching and their influence on the etching rates on LR-115 films.Concept of break down thickness of the SSNTD film in spark counting technique isdiscussed with experimental results.

Theoverall results show that the tracks obtained by spark counting are marginally lesscompared to the optical measurement. A linear fit of the data gives a slope lessthat one, which indicates that both the methods are almost in good agreement forcounting the tracks when the track density is low.

It need not be overemphasized that the miniaturization of devices and synthesis of new materials have a tremendous role in the development of powerful electronics as well as material based technologies in other areas but for the laws of quantum mechanics posing limitations besides the increasing cost and difficulties in manufacturing in such a small scale. The quest, therefore, for the alternative technologies, have stimulated a surge of interest in nano-meter scale materials and devices in the recent years. Metallic as well as semiconducting nano wires are the most attractive materials because of their unique properties having myriad of applications like interconnects for nano-electronics, magnetic devices, chemical and biosensors, whereas the hollow tubules are equally considered to be candidates for more potent applications   both in physical as well as biosciences. Materials  processing for nano-structured devices is indispensable to their rational design. The technique, known as  Template Synthesis , using electrochemical.electro less deposition is one of the most important processes for manufacturing nano.micro structures, nano-composites and devices and is relatively inexpensive and simple. The technique involves using membranes   ion crafted ones (popularly known as Particle Track-Etch Membranes or Nuclear Track Filters), alumite substrate membranes, besides other types of membranes as templates. The parameters viz., diameter as well as length i.e., aspect ratio, shape and wall surface traits in these membranes are controllable.

The environmental surface gamma dose ratewas also measured in the same area. The radon exhalation rate in the soil samplecollected from different geological unit of Budhakedar area was measured usingplastic track detector (LR-115 type II) technique. The variation in the radonconcentration in soil-gas was found to vary from 1098 to 31,776 Bq.m3 with anaverage of 7456 Bq.m3 in summer season and 3501 to 42883 Bq.m3 with an average of17148 Bq.m3 in winter season. In groundwater, it was found to vary from 8 to 3047Bq.l1 with an average value 510 Bq.l1 in summer and 26 to 2311 Bq.l1 with anaverage value 433 Bq.L1 in winter. Surface gamma dose rate in the study area variedfrom 32.4 to 83.6 .R.h1 with an overall mean of 58.7 .R.h1 in summer and 34.6 to79.3 .R.h1 with an average value 58.2 .R.h1 in winter.

Governmentsand industries of many countries are investing more money than before in science research. As a result, researchoutput in terms of publications of original research articles has been increased substantially in the recent past. Sothere is a steady growth in STM journal publishing industries too. But unfortunately journals published byuniversities and learned societies of third world countries are facing a stiff competition from large commercialpublishing houses and those are on the verge of extinction due to merger and acquisitions by large commercialpublishers. India is one of the fastest growing nations in terms of research output in science. Over the last fewyears India is trying to establish herself as a global leader in science. The number of original research articlespublished by Indian scientists has been increased substantially in the recent past. But very few journals in scienceand specifically in the subject physics with high impact factor are published from India. As a result Indian scientistshave no choice but to use journals with high impact factor published from outside India to publish their researchoutput. Amongst the core physics journals published from India, Indian Journal of Physics (IJP) is one brightexception. It not only survived the stiff challenges from commercial publishers but also excelled in many waysthat is clearly visible with steady increase in its impact factor over the last few years and for the year 2012 theimpact factor of IJP is 1.785 that is highest for any physics journal published from India and comparable withother well known physics journals published from USA and European countries. Bibliometric and scientometricstudies were carried out for individual journals in the past for different purposes. IJP is now in the centre ofattention to physicists all over the world because of its reasonably good impact factor and the journal is gettingmore number of original articles from all over the world. The objective of this study is to throw light on the factorsthose play the vital role for the improvement of its quality by analysing different bibliometric and scientometricdata for IJP. The result of this study may be useful and the measures taken by IJP can be extrapolated to othersimilar journals published by universities and societies from third world countries for improvement.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], relation=[10th;page 209-216], educationalAlignment_educationalLevel=[ug_pg], publisher=[10th International Conference on Webometrics, Informetrics and Scientometrics & 15th COLLNET Meeting 2014], identifier_uri=[http://hdl.handle.net/10821/416], learningResourceType=[article]}

The uniqueness of this molecule has been revealed through linear free energy relationshipbased KamletTaft analysis which indicates that the polarizability (p?) and the hydrogen bond acceptorabilities (b) of the solvent are mainly responsible for the observed absorption spectra of the probe whilepolarizability (p?) and the hydrogen bond donor abilities (a) of the solvents mainly determine its emittingprofile. This investigation helps us to decipher the ground and excited state behavior of the hydrogenbonding sites present in PACO.

A difference in the first hyperpolarizabilities (?_{total}) of isomeric organic chromophores containing the same donor and acceptor groups indicate the possible role of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in shaping the NLO response in these ?-conjugated molecular chromophores. A correlation is sought to be established among calculated ? _{total} on one hand and the donor strength, the strength of the acceptor, donor-acceptor interaction and the donor-acceptor separation, on the other by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search through the relevant parameter space. It appears that ?_{total} of a molecule is dominantly determined by additive contributions from the donors and the acceptors.

In those having lower refractive index, theformer of these two is more intense, With increasing refraction, the lattergains in intensity over the former and becomes more prominent.

The polyethylene-b-polyethylene glycol block copolymer intercalates with the sodium dodecyl sulfate anionic surfactant to form self-aggregated nanocomposites. These nanocomposites interact with the donor molecules in aqueous solution to form vesicles, and the donor molecules become attached on the outer wall by hydrogen bonding. The acceptor molecules are observed to be loaded in the vesicular interior. By controlling the spectral overlap of the donor and acceptor molecules by changing the pH of the medium, the energy-transfer efficiency in vesicles has been studied. The efficiency of energy transfer in vesicular media (55%) is found to be less compared to that in aqueous media (80%) at pH 7. The fall in efficiency has been attributed to the perturbation imparted by the vesicular wall due to the good matching of the donoracceptor distance with the wall thickness. At low pH, the efficiency shows an abrupt increase (95%) due to the release of the acceptor molecules from the vesicular medium causing subsequent reduction of donoracceptor separation and an increase of the spectral overlap at that pH.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], relation=[Volume 116, Number 8, Year 2012;Page no 2464-2471], educationalAlignment_educationalLevel=[ug_pg], publisher=[American Chemical Society], identifier_uri=[http://hdl.handle.net/10821/280], learningResourceType=[article]}

One such material, ZnO has beenshown to be a potential Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS). The appearance of ferromagnetism, however,is found to be sensitive to the processing conditions. We report synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles of size ~20 nmby a simple co-precipitation technique using metal nitrates and NaOH as precipitant. The particles are selforganisedand reveal single crystalline behaviour in electron diffraction pattern. Incorporation of Co in ZnO matrixleads not only to the reduction in crystallite size but also to the modification of the structure. At 5% Co, theparticles are highly textured. The particles also aggregate and the aggregated mass have nearly rectangularshape as seen through TEM. Increasing Co to 10%, results into further reduction of particle size and the particlesself organize in a line, which looks like nanofibers. This alignment of particles increases by increasing the Cocontent further. This type of growth of nanofibers above Co ? 10% is well correlated with the anisotropic peakbroadening observed in the XRD spectra. In addition, Co substitute Zn site up to 20% without showing any extraphase in XRD spectra as compared to 7 to 10% in case of bulk. Transport and magnetic studies indicate thatconductivity increases with increasing Co content, but carrier mediated ferromagnetism is absent down to 10 K.], source_uri=[http://www.iacs.res.in/], educationalAlignment_educationalLevel=[ug_pg], publisher=[Indian J.
